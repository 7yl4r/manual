## Contribute to OBIS

Any organization, consortium, project or individual may contribute to OBIS.

Datasets can be provided to a Regional OBIS Node, the central data portal, or another existing Data Provider, and it is published from there. In order to enhance standardisation, there is an Excel spreadsheet avalable for download from here, which mimics the structure of the data format. The spreadsheet is self-explanatory (we hope), but do not hesitate to contact us for more help. Also look below (section on data schema) for more information on the different fields.

## Guidelines for Contribution

### Publishing Sensitive Data

OBIS is committed to keeping its data free and openly accessible for the public. So, if you have sensitive data you probably don't want to publish it through OBIS (or any other publication). However, there are some particular concerns we may be able to help with.

- If you are concerned about giving the precise location of a rare or commercial species, then we may be able to represent your data at a lower spatial resolution, or to give a bounding box instead of a point location.
- If you have data that you would like to publish but want to wait until its analysis is published elsewhere, we can help you set up your dataset appropriately now, but agree not to publish it for a certain amount of time.
Payment

OBIS does not buy data. It is a group of contributors who have agreed to publish their data through a central portal to make it more accessible. However, we may be able to make suggestions for places where you could submit a proposal to fund developing datasets or for digitizing existing datasets.

### Intellectual Property Rights

OBIS does not claim ownership or rights to the data sets it publishes. All rights remain with the data source, whether distributed directly or mediated, whom may at any time decide to remove their data from OBIS.

### Citation and Credit

All data published through OBIS are labelled with the organization and database from which the data came, and a standard citation is provided.

Users are expected to cite the data providers when using data from OBIS as they would cite papers from a conventional print publication.

If you would like to contribute to the OBIS system, please contact us by email at <a href="mailto:info@iobis.org">info@iobis.org</a>.

We will then help you plan the technical aspects of connecting to the OBIS website.
