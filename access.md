# Data access
## Mapper

- <https://mapper.obis.org>

The mapper allows users to visualize and inspect subsets of OBIS data. A variety of filters (taxonomic, geographic, time, data quality) is available and multiple layers can be combined in a single view. Layers can be downloaded as CSV files.

## R package

- <https://github.com/iobis/robis>
- [Data access using the robis R package](/accessr)

Our R package provides direct access to the OBIS database from R.

## API

- <https://api.obis.org/>

Both the mapper and the R package are based on the OBIS API which can be used by third party developers as well.

## Full exports

- <https://obis.org/data/access/>

Full exports of the quality controlled presence records as CSV or Parquet (see below).
