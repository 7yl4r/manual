# Contribute data to OBIS

OBIS accepts data from any organization, consortium, project or individual who wants to contribute data. OBIS Data Sources are the authors, editors, and/or organisations that have published one or more datasets through OBIS. They are the owners or custodians of the data, not OBIS! However, OBIS only harvests data from recognized OBIS nodes. If you own data or have the right to share data with OBIS, you can contact the [OBIS secretariat or one of the OBIS nodes](https://obis.org/contact/). Your organization or programme can also become an OBIS node.
